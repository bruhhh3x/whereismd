# Access Initiation (Vanilla JS Version)

This is a zero-dependency version of the Access Initiation app
implemented in plain JavaScript (no React, no build step).

## How to use with GitHub Pages

1. Create a new GitHub repo.
2. Put **all files from this folder** at the **root** of the repo:
   - `index.html`
   - `app.js`
   - `README.md`
   - `LICENSE`
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** in the repo:
   - Source: `main` (or your branch)
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Visit: `https://YOUR-USER.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`

There is no build process. GitHub only needs to serve `index.html`
and `app.js`, and the app will run.
